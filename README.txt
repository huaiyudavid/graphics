Old instructions can be found in "README.md".

To compile, go into "src/" and run "make". I moved all the code into the "src" folder.

A basic sphere and triangle image can be made by running "read ../scripts/basic.cli", then running "trace".

The required scene can be made by running "read ../scripts/reflect.cli". No need to call trace after this one.
The scene takes about 333 milliseconds to render, the actual time is reported when trace is run.
The resulting tiff image is stored in /images/reflect.tiff

No extra credit was completed this time.
